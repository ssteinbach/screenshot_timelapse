# Screenshot Timelapse

Simple tool for building timelapses by periodically invoking the mac os x
screenshot utility.  Runs in two steps:

1. `capture_timelapse.py`: captures images into /var/tmp and builds a small json
2. `mk_timelapse_movie.py`: takes the json generated by `capture_timelapse.py`
   and turns it into a movie using ffmpeg.
3. Enjoy!

# Dependencies

- Assumes that `ffmpeg` is installed w/ libx265
- `mk_timelapse_movie.py` additionally has a `RV` preview mode that requires RV
  installed.

# Other notes

Good luck!
